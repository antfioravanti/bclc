# bclc — Bias-Corrected Lattice Covariance Estimation

On an `n1 × n2` rectangular lattice the naive sample autocovariance `Chat(h)` is
**biased**, and the bias grows with the lag `|h|`. `bclc` removes that bias with a
linear correction: the truncated vector of sample autocovariances is multiplied by
the inverse of a deterministic **weight matrix** `W*_m` that depends only on the grid
geometry (`n1, n2, m`) — not on the data or the unknown parameters:

```
C*_m = (W*_m)^{-1} Chat_m
```

The weight matrix is derived under the modified exponential covariance model, and the
correction itself is fully non-parametric at estimation time.

## Installation

The package uses Rcpp / RcppArmadillo, so a working C++ toolchain is required
(Rtools on Windows, Xcode CLT on macOS, `r-base-dev` on Linux).

```r
# from the parent directory that contains bclc/
install.packages(c("Rcpp", "RcppArmadillo", "MASS"))   # core deps
devtools::install("bclc")
library(bclc)
```
## Example

**1) Simulate one Gaussian realisation on a 20 × 20 lattice** — a separable
exponential covariance (`beta = 0`) with medium spatial dependence (`lambda = 4`):

```r
library(bclc)

sim <- simulate_lattice_process(
  n1 = 20, n2 = 20,
  sigma   = 1,
  alpha1  = 1, alpha2  = 1,
  lambda1 = 4, lambda2 = 4,
  beta    = 0,
  seed    = 1
)
```

The result holds the data matrix and the parameters used to generate it:

- `sim$X` — the 20 × 20 data matrix
- `sim$Sigma` — the true N × N covariance used to generate `X`
- `sim$params` — the parameters above

**2) Bias-corrected estimate**, truncating lags to `{-m,...,m}^2` with `m = 3` estimating with bias correction:

```r
fit <- bias_corrected_estimator(sim$X, m = 3)
```

This returns both the naive and the corrected autocovariances:

- `fit$Chat_m` — naive sample autocovariances (vectorised, column-major)
- `fit$Chat_star_m` — bias-corrected autocovariances (same ordering)
- `fit$W_star_m` — the weight matrix that was inverted

Both vectors are named `C(h1,h2)` in column-major lag order, so you can compare the
naive and corrected values lag by lag:

```r
head(data.frame(naive = fit$Chat_m, corrected = fit$Chat_star_m), 9)
```

## Turning the estimate into an N×N covariance matrix

`reshape_Sigma_hat_m()` reshapes the corrected lag vector into a lag-indexed matrix
and a plug-in field covariance matrix (zero outside the `m`-window):

```r
res <- reshape_Sigma_hat_m(fit$Chat_star_m, m = 3, n1 = 20, n2 = 20)

res$Gamma_hat_corr_m   # (2m+1) x (2m+1) lag matrix, rows = h1, cols = h2
res$Sigma_hat_m        # N x N covariance matrix

# The reshaped matrix is not guaranteed PSD; project if you need a valid covariance:
Sigma_psd <- psd_project(res$Sigma_hat_m)
is_psd(Sigma_psd)      # TRUE
```

## Notation and conventions

- **Lag matrix.** For a grid of size `n` per axis there are `L = 2n - 1` lags,
  running `{-(n-1), …, 0, …, n-1}`. The truncated window keeps `{-m,…,m}^2`.
- **`h1` is the vertical (row) lag, `h2` the horizontal (column) lag** — fixed
  everywhere.
- **Vectorisation is column-major** (R / Armadillo default): lag `(h1,h2)` sits at
  position `k = (h2 + m)(2m+1) + (h1 + m)` (0-based) in the truncated vector.
- **Normalisation.** `Nh_normalize = TRUE` (the default) uses the `N_h`
  normalisation throughout — keep it consistent between the estimator and any MSE
  comparison.
- **Separable Covariance.** `beta = 0` giving a separable model and `beta > 0` 
a non-separable one.
